# llm-gateway

> Plug-and-play LLM gateway with a self-auditor built in. Drop it in front of any
> LLM call in any app. Every call is logged, every call is measured, and the
> gateway audits its own code on demand.

OpenAI-compatible at the edge. If your code already calls OpenAI's REST API,
you point it at the gateway and you're done.

---

## What it does

- **Routes** every production LLM call through a Bitdeer-only chain
  (`BITDEER_*` / `NVIDIA_*` aliases, nvidia catalog models) with circuit
  breaking, per-call cost/latency tracking, and a SQLite call log. Extra
  GEMINI/XAI/KIMI/OPENAI keys are optional fail-soft **side tools**, not chat defaults.
- **Self-audits** with a 5-phase algorithm:
  1. **Inventory** — sha256 every `.ts/.js/.mjs/.json` file in the repo
  2. **Baseline** — measure health latency, memory, and self-availability
  3. **Static** — run 22 rules over the source (P0 crash/security, P1 perf, P2 hygiene)
  4. **Verify** — for every claimed fix in `CHANGELOG.md`, confirm the symbol still exists
  5. **Report** — return `VERIFIED_COMPLETE` / `PARTIAL` / `BLOCKED` / `FAILED`
- **Exposes** the audit on HTTP so any app (or cron) can hit it.

---

## Plug it into any app (3 lines)

```js
import { GatewayClient } from 'llm-gateway/client';
const gw = new GatewayClient({ baseUrl: 'https://your-gateway', apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const r = await gw.chat({ model: 'gpt-4o', messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'hi' }] });
```

Or, with the **raw OpenAI SDK** (no import needed — just change baseURL):
```js
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, baseURL: 'https://your-gateway/v1' });
```

For **Express apps**:
```js
import { gateway } from 'llm-gateway/middleware';
app.use('/llm', gateway({ baseUrl: 'https://your-gateway' }));
```

For **anything else** (Python, Go, Zapier, cURL): hit the HTTP endpoint directly.
It's OpenAI-compatible.

Auth header: `X-AION-Key: <key>` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. The CORS
preflight response advertises `x-aion-key` in `access-control-allow-headers`
so browser clients sending the header don't get rejected.

### BOS-OMEGA Brain (self-audit → research → propose)

| Method | Path                          | Auth   | Purpose                                          |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/brain/audit-and-fix`        | none   | Run audit → research → propose cycle (`{apply?, severities?}`); `apply:true` only re-applies already-verified local patches, never writes new/hallucinated code |
| GET    | `/brain/status`                | none   | Brain capability + policy description             |

SSE event names (exact match with AION v2 backend):
```
data: {"type":"decision","decision":{"state":"COMMIT","score":0.75,"checks":[...]}}
data: {"type":"attempt","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","index":1}
data: {"type":"open","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini"}
data: {"type":"delta","text":"..."}
data: {"type":"done","streaming":"simulated","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","latency_ms":1203,"finish_reason":"stop"}
data: [DONE]
```

On the execute path (`/api/claw/execute` or actionable `/api/chat`), additional
**separate** event types may appear: `self_state`, `phase`, `tool_start`,
`tool_end`. They are not assistant text. Clients must render only `delta`
(and the JSON `answer` field) as the user-visible reply.

> **Note on streaming:** as of v0.1.9 OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI, NVIDIA NIM, etc.)
> use **true token streaming** via `streamChat()`. The `done` / `open` events carry
> `"streaming": "true"`. Providers without a stream implementation (Echo, Anthropic
> until added) still fall back to simulated chunking and report `"streaming": "simulated"`.

### Per-request credentials

The gateway accepts credentials via headers on every request, so a single
deployment can serve multiple apps without leaking keys:

```
x-bitdeer-key:   ...                  (or x-nvidia-key)
x-aion-key:      ...                  (AION /api/* auth)
x-app-id:        my-app-name          (for call-log attribution)
x-request-id:    uuid-v4              (echoed back, logged on errors)
```

If no header is provided, the gateway falls back to its own env-var config.

---

## Self-auditor

```bash
# From the CLI
node bin/audit.mjs                 # full 5-phase audit
node bin/audit.mjs --quick         # health + drift only
node bin/audit.mjs --json          # raw JSON to stdout

# From HTTP
curl https://your-gateway/audit           # last report
curl -X POST https://your-gateway/audit/run   # run fresh
curl https://your-gateway/audit/quick
```

Example output:
```
=== llm-gateway self-audit (full) ===
status:           VERIFIED_COMPLETE
duration:         72ms
files inventoried:10
findings:         P0=0  P1=16  P2=26
verified fixes:   4   unverified: 0
```

The auditor catches its own bugs. If you write a "fix" in the changelog and
the symbol isn't in the source, the audit will report it as `unverified`.

---

## Provider chain (env-driven)

Production inference is **BITDEER-PRIMARY** (fail-closed):

1. `BITDEER_API_KEY` / `BITDEER_API_KEYS` (or `NVIDIA_*` aliases) → Bitdeer
2. `AION_ECHO_ONLY=1` → EchoProvider (hermetic tests / offline)
3. (no Bitdeer key and not echo-only) → EchoProvider so local tests still boot

`PRIMARY_MODEL` defaults to `zai-org/GLM-5`. `AGENT_MODEL` defaults to
`mistralai/Mistral-Large-3-675B-Instruct-2512`. Production startup rejects
non-catalog models. GEMINI/XAI/KIMI/OPENAI keys never join this chain;
they back optional tools (`gemini_chat`, `xai_chat`, `kimi_chat`, `openai_chat`).

Each provider auto-fails over to the next on retriable errors (5xx, 429, network).
Non-retriable errors (401, 403, 400) stop the chain. Circuit breaker opens
after 3 consecutive failures and recovers after 30s.

---

## Run locally

`ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `production`, and in production the server **fail-closes
at startup** (`process.exit(1)`) unless `AION_API_KEYS` and `AION_ADMIN_KEYS`
(comma-separated key lists) are set — see `lib/aion_settings.js`. Running
`node server.js` with no env vars will crash immediately with
`aion.startup.fatal: AION_API_KEYS must be configured in production`.

Pick one:

**Option A — real keys** (also required for `/api/*` AION routes):
```bash
npm install
AION_API_KEYS=dev-user-key AION_ADMIN_KEYS=dev-admin-key node server.js
# → llm-gateway listening on :10000
```

**Option B — no keys, unauthenticated dev mode** (`/api/*` AION routes accept
any/no request as an admin principal; fine for local hacking, never for a
shared or public deployment):
```bash
npm install
ENVIRONMENT=development ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_DEV=true node server.js
# → llm-gateway listening on :10000
```

The OpenAI-compatible `/v1/*` surface works either way with no LLM provider
keys set — it falls back to the offline `EchoProvider`.

```bash
npm test
# → runs the self-contained smoke + streaming + contract suites
```

---

## Deploy

```bash
# Render: link the repo, set start command to `node server.js`
# Or run anywhere Node 18+ is available.
```

The gateway is stateless except for the SQLite file in `LLM_GATEWAY_DATA_DIR`.
Mount a persistent disk if you want to survive restarts.

## Why "gateway + auditor in one"?

Because that's the only way the auditor is honest. If the audit code lives
in a separate repo, the gateway can lie about its own health. If it lives
inside the same process and runs against the same `node_modules`, then a
green `/audit` is real proof the build is sound.

This is the principle: **the system performs its own duties within itself.**
